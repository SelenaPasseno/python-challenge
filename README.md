#PyBank Instructions

#In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. 
#The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

#1) The total number of months included in the dataset
#2) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#3) The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
#4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
#5) The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#Analysis should align with the following results:

#Financial Analysis
#----------------------------
#Total Months: 86
#Total: $22564198
#Average Change: $-8311.11
#Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
#Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

#In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
